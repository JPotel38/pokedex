# Pokédex
A Pokédex made to improve my skills in front-end.
Made with Angular.
Ionic was used as a UI toolkit, to make it responsive on mobiles.

Among the basic features, you can toggle the dark mode, or switch between english and french.

It's possible to search for a specific Pokémon by name, or filter them by their types (one or two types). You also have a special 'Legendary' button to retrieve all the awesome ones.

In this application, I mocked-up a login/ signin feature, using the Session Storage of the brower and Behavior Subjects from Rxjs.

Once you're connected, you can add and delete Pokémons to your team. If needed, you can change their names, as well as yours.

More features incoming !
